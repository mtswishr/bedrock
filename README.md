This is a custom HTTP server

It is just so I can learn about HTTP internals

Using (the RFC as the implementation reference)[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-6]

Per the spec: 
>   An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
>   of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocols it
>   implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED
>   level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said
>   to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST
>   level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its
>   protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."

The first goal is become conditionally compliant with the spec
